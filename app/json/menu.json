    "description" : "Unlike summer cooking, food for a cold snowy winter should be heavy, high calorie, thick, and filling.  The following duck recipe fulfills every criterion of the above descriptions.   Taro root is native to Southeast Asia but is found around the world.  The taro cake is also a delicacy traditionally eaten during the Chinese New Year.  Taro was consumed by the early Romans in much the same way the potato is today. They called this root vegetable colocasia.Duck meat has higher calorie content than chicken.  It makes duck a perfect dish for a snowy winter dinner.  Most super markets in North America would only carry frozen duck.  You also can find fresh duck if you look hard enough in some regional smaller poultry stores.",
